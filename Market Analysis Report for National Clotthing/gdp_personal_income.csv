Legend/Footnotes
1/ The estimates of earnings for 1998-2006 are based on the 2002 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The estimates for 2007-2010 are based on the 2007 NAICS. The estimates for 2011-2016 are based on the 2012 NAICS. The estimates for 2017 forward are based on the 2017 NAICS.
"2/ Census Bureau midyear population estimate. BEA produced intercensal annual state population statistics for 2010 to 2019 that are tied to the Census Bureau decennial counts for 2010 and 2020. BEA developed intercensal population statistics because this data was not published when Census released state population data for 2020 and 2021, which are based on the 2020 decennial counts. BEA used the Census Bureau Das Gupta method (see https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/methodology/intercensal/2000-2010-intercensal-estimates-methodology.pdf), modified to account for an extra leap year day, to produce the intercensal population figures that will be used until Census releases its official intercensal population data."
"3/ Per capita personal income is total personal income divided by total midyear population. BEA produced intercensal population figures for 2010 to 2019 that are tied to the Census Bureau decennial counts for 2010 and 2020 to create consistent time series that are used to prepare per capita personal income statistics. BEA used the Census Bureau Das Gupta method (see https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/methodology/intercensal/2000-2010-intercensal-estimates-methodology.pdf), modified to account for an extra leap year day, to produce the intercensal population figures that will be used until Census releases its official intercensal population data."
"4/ Employer contributions for government social insurance are included in earnings by industry and earnings by place of work, but they are excluded from net earnings by place of residence and personal income. Employee and self-employed contributions are subtractions in the calculation of net earnings by place of residence and all of the income measures."
"5/ The adjustment for residence is the net inflow of the earnings of interarea commuters. For the United States, it consists of adjustments for border workers and US residents employed by international organizations and foreign embassies."
6/ Rental income of persons includes the capital consumption adjustment.
7/ Includes actual employer contributions and actuarially imputed employer contributions to reflect benefits accrued by defined benefit pension plan participants through service to employers in the current period.
8/ Proprietors' income includes the inventory valuation adjustment and the capital consumption adjustment.
"9/ Under the 2007 NAICS, internet publishing and broadcasting was reclassified to other information services."
Note. All dollar estimates are in thousands of current dollars (not adjusted for inflation). Statistics presented in thousands of dollars do not indicate more precision than statistics presented in millions of dollars.
